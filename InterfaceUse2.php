<!-- 
    
Cat, Dog and Mouse are all classes that implement the Animal interface, which means that all of them are able to make a sound using the makeSound() method. Because of this, we can loop through all of the animals and tell them to make a sound even if we don't know what type of animal each one is.

Since the interface does not tell the classes how to implement the method, each animal can make a sound in its own way.

<?php
// Interface definition
interface Animal {
  public function makeSound();
}

// Class definitions
class Cat implements Animal {
  public function makeSound() {
    echo " Meow ";
  }
}

class Dog implements Animal {
  public function makeSound() {
    echo " Bark ";
  }
}

class Mouse implements Animal {
  public function makeSound() {
    echo " Squeak ";
  }
}

// Create a list of animals
$cat = new Cat();
$dog = new Dog();
$mouse = new Mouse();
$animals = array($cat, $dog, $mouse);

// Tell the animals to make a sound
foreach($animals as $animal) {
  $animal->makeSound();
}
?>
